# ðŸ§  Context Awareness System

*Load this file for multi-session work or agent handoffs*

## How Context Works

1. **First Agent**: Creates session, initializes context
2. **Subsequent Agents**: Read context, build on existing work
3. **Continuous Updates**: Every decision shared immediately
4. **Next Session**: Picks up exactly where you left off

## Context Files

```
.claude/context/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared-context.json  # All agent decisions
â”œâ”€â”€ session.json         # Session continuity
â””â”€â”€ vocabulary.json      # Project terminology
```

## Context Protocol

### Before Starting Work
1. ALWAYS read `.claude/context/shared-context.json`
2. Check what has been done already
3. Identify dependencies and related work
4. Avoid duplicating existing solutions

### During Work
1. Document major decisions in context
2. Use consistent terminology
3. Reference previous work by ID
4. Keep updates concise and actionable

### After Completing Work
1. Update shared-context.json with results
2. Mark tasks as completed
3. Add new pending tasks if discovered
4. Suggest next agent if handoff needed

## Vocabulary Learning

The system adapts to project-specific terminology:
- Learns from code patterns
- Adapts to domain language
- Maintains consistency across agents
- Updates `.claude/context/vocabulary.json`

## Session Persistence

Work continues seamlessly across Claude sessions:
- Session ID persists indefinitely
- All decisions preserved
- Task progress tracked
- No repeated explanations needed

### CLI Session Continuity

For Claude Code CLI interactions:
1. **Auto-Resume**: Detect and continue previous work automatically
2. **Context Loading**: Read shared-context.json on every CLI command
3. **State Tracking**: Maintain workflow state between commands
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn user's CLI usage patterns

Example CLI continuity:
```json
{
  "cli_session": {
    "last_command": "build dashboard",
    "active_agents": ["rapid-ui-designer"],
    "workflow_stage": "component_creation",
    "next_steps": ["styling", "state_management"]
  }
}
```

### Cross-Session Commands

Common CLI patterns to recognize:
- "Continue" â†’ Resume last workflow
- "Status" â†’ Show current context state
- "What's next?" â†’ Suggest next steps from context
- "Finish up" â†’ Complete pending tasks
