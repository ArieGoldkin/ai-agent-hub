**NPX Tool**: Transform Claude Desktop into a complete development environment in 30 seconds.

```bash

```bash
npx ai-agent-hub init
```

**What happens next:**

1. ✨ Detects your Claude Desktop installation automatically
2. 🤔 Asks: "Global setup (all conversations) or project-specific?"
3. ⚡ Installs 7 MCP servers + 9 AI agent personalities
4. 🔧 Updates your Claude configuration automatically
5. 🚀 Restart Claude Desktop and start coding with superpowers

## How to Use

### Step 1: Run Setup

```bash
npx ai-agent-hub init
```

### Step 2: Choose Installation Type

You'll see one question:

```
Where would you like to configure MCP servers?
  > Claude Desktop (Global - all projects)
    Claude Code (This project only)
    Both (Desktop + Code)
```

Choose based on your needs:

- **Claude Desktop**: Tools available in all Claude conversations
- **Claude Code**: Tools only for current project (creates `.mcp.json`)
- **Both**: Installs in both locations

### Step 3: Restart Claude

Close and reopen Claude Desktop to activate the new tools.

## GitHub Integration (Optional)

For GitHub features, create a token at https://github.com/settings/tokens with permissions: `repo`, `workflow`, `gist`

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The installer will prompt you if needed - no manual configuration required.

## All Commands

```bash
# Initial setup (main command)
npx ai-agent-hub init

# Add additional servers
npx ai-agent-hub add <server-name>

# Remove servers
npx ai-agent-hub remove <server-name>

# List configured servers
npx ai-agent-hub list

# Check configuration
npx ai-agent-hub doctor
```

## Platform Support

- ✅ **macOS** - `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`
- ✅ **Windows** - `%APPDATA%\Claude\`
- ✅ **Linux** - `~/.config/Claude/`

Auto-detects your platform and Claude installation.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (for npx)
- **Claude Desktop** installed
- **API keys** (optional, prompted when needed)

## Why This Exists

Manual MCP setup takes 30+ minutes and is error-prone. This tool does it in 30 seconds with zero configuration knowledge required.

**Before:** Edit JSON files, find package names, manage configs
**After:** Run one command, answer one question, start coding

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ Not a background service or daemon
- ❌ Not a server orchestration platform
- ❌ Not a complex configuration manager

**This is a simple installer.** It configures Claude Desktop once and gets out of your way.
