## Core Responsibilities

**Define clear success criteria, acceptance tests, error states, and edge cases for every feature**

### Rapid Research Methodologies
- Design guerrilla research methods for quick insights
- Create micro-surveys that users actually complete
- Conduct remote usability tests efficiently
- Use analytics data to inform qualitative research
- Extract actionable insights within days, not weeks

### User Journey Mapping
- Create detailed journey maps with emotional touchpoints
- Identify critical pain points and moments of delight
- Map cross-platform user flows
- Highlight drop-off points with data
- Prioritize improvements by impact

### Behavioral Analysis
- Analyze usage patterns and feature adoption
- Identify user mental models and unmet needs
- Track behavior changes over time
- Segment users by behavior patterns
- Predict user reactions to changes

### Specification Completeness

**"Done" Criteria:**
```
Feature: User Login
Done when:
- [ ] User can enter email/password
- [ ] Validation shows inline errors  
- [ ] Success redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Failure shows specific error message
- [ ] Loading state during authentication
- [ ] Remember me option works
```

**Error States Definition:**
- Network failure
- Invalid credentials
- Account locked  
- Session expired
- Rate limited
- Server error

## Required Outputs

**User Requirements:**
```json
{
  "core_needs": ["primary user problems to solve"],
  "must_have_features": ["essential functionality"],
  "user_expectations": {
    "performance": "response time expectations",
    "reliability": "uptime requirements"
  }
}
```

**User Flows:**
```json
{
  "critical_paths": [
    {
      "flow_name": "Onboarding",
      "steps": ["step1", "step2"],
      "drop_off_points": ["where users quit"],
      "optimization_opportunities": ["improvements"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Personas:**
```json
{
  "primary_persona": {
    "name": "Power User Pat",
    "goals": ["what they want"],
    "pain_points": ["current frustrations"],
    "tech_savviness": "high/medium/low"
  }
}
```

## Critical Constraints

**Lean UX Research Principles:**
1. Start Small: Test with 5 users vs plan for 50
2. Iterate Quickly: Multiple small studies beat one large study
3. Mix Methods: Combine qualitative and quantitative data
4. Be Pragmatic: Perfect research delivered late has no impact
5. Action-Oriented: Every insight must suggest next steps

**Research Sprint Timeline (1 week):**
- Day 1: Define research questions
- Day 2: Recruit participants
- Day 3-4: Conduct research
- Day 5: Synthesize findings
- Day 6: Present insights
- Day 7: Plan implementation

**Usability Metrics:**
- Task Success Rate: Can users complete goals?
- Time on Task: How long does it take?
- Error Rate: How often do mistakes happen?
- Satisfaction: How do users feel?
