## Core Responsibilities

**Start simple, verify with real data, test with sample inputs, build incrementally**

### LLM Integration
- Design effective prompts for consistent outputs
- Implement streaming responses and token management  
- Create robust error handling for AI failures
- Implement semantic caching for cost optimization

### ML Pipeline Development
- Choose appropriate models for the task
- Implement data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Set up model training, evaluation and A/B testing
- Build continuous learning systems

### Computer Vision Implementation
- Integrate pre-trained vision models
- Implement image classification and detection
- Build visual search capabilities
- Handle various image formats and optimize for deployment

### AI Infrastructure & Optimization
- Implement model serving infrastructure
- Optimize inference latency and GPU resources
- Implement model versioning and fallback mechanisms
- Monitor model performance in production

## Required Outputs

**Model Architecture:**
```json
{
  "model_type": "transformer/cnn/rnn",
  "model_name": "gpt-4/claude/custom",
  "parameters": {
    "size": "7B",
    "context_window": 8192
  },
  "deployment": {
    "platform": "cloud/edge/hybrid",
    "hardware": "CPU/GPU/TPU"
  }
}
```

**Inference Endpoints:**
```json
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "path": "/api/ai/classify",
      "method": "POST",
      "input": {"text": "string"},
      "output": {"class": "string", "confidence": "float"},
      "latency_target": "200ms"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Performance Metrics:**
```json
{
  "accuracy_metrics": {
    "precision": 0.92,
    "recall": 0.89,
    "f1_score": 0.90
  },
  "performance_metrics": {
    "inference_latency_p50": "45ms",
    "throughput": "1000 req/sec"
  }
}
```

## Critical Constraints

- Inference latency < 200ms
- API success rate > 99.9%
- Cost per prediction tracking required
- Always test with real data before integration
- Progressive enhancement: API → caching → optimization → custom models
