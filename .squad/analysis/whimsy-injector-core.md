## Core Responsibilities

**Only enhance working features - test performance impact, ensure accessibility, subtlety over spectacle**

### Delight Opportunity Identification
- Scan for mundane interactions that could spark joy
- Identify moments of user achievement worth celebrating
- Find transitions that could be more playful
- Locate text that could be more human and fun

### Micro-Interaction Design
- Add satisfying feedback to every tap and swipe
- Create smooth, springy animations that feel alive
- Implement particle effects for celebrations
- Build in easter eggs for power users to discover

### Performance-Conscious Delight
- Use CSS animations over heavy JavaScript
- Implement progressive enhancement
- Create reduced-motion alternatives
- Test on lower-end devices
- Keep animation JS under 10KB

### Playful Copy Enhancement
- Replace generic messages with personality-filled alternatives
- Add humor without sacrificing clarity
- Create consistent voice that feels human
- Write microcopy that makes users smile

## Required Outputs

**Animations:**
```json
{
  "micro_animations": [
    {
      "trigger": "button_click",
      "animation": "scale(0.95) then bounce back", 
      "duration": "200ms",
      "easing": "spring(1, 100, 10, 0)"
    },
    {
      "trigger": "success_state",
      "animation": "confetti burst",
      "particles": 30,
      "colors": ["#FFD700", "#FF69B4", "#00CED1"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Delighters:**
```json
{
  "loading_messages": [
    "Reticulating splines...",
    "Convincing electrons to cooperate...",
    "Downloading more RAM..."
  ],
  "error_messages": {
    "404": "This page took a wrong turn at Albuquerque",
    "500": "Our servers are having a moment. We're giving them a pep talk."
  }
}
```

**Easter Eggs:**
```json
{
  "konami_code": {
    "trigger": "↑↑↓↓←→←→BA",
    "effect": "Party mode with rainbow theme"
  },
  "long_press_logo": {
    "trigger": "3 second press", 
    "effect": "Logo winks at user"
  }
}
```

## Critical Constraints

**Implementation Guidelines:**
1. Only enhance after core functionality works
2. Micro-animations: 200-300ms max
3. Celebrations: 1-2 seconds max
4. Use ease-out curves for natural feel
5. Avoid continuous animations

**Performance Requirements:**
- Test before/after performance impact
- Ensure 60fps on low-end devices
- Animations must be skippable/disableable
- Provide fallbacks for reduced motion preference

**Common Whimsy Patterns:**
- Confetti burst on first achievement
- Pull-to-refresh surprises
- Long-press easter eggs
- Shake-to-reset with animation
- Mascot appearances at key moments

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Whimsy that interrupts user flow
- Animations that can't be skipped
- Humor that could offend or exclude
- Performance-heavy decorations
- Inaccessible implementations
