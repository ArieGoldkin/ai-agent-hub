## Core Responsibilities

**Account for real development time: 30% testing/debugging, 20% buffer, incremental stages**

### Sprint Planning Excellence
- Define clear, measurable sprint goals
- Break down features into shippable increments
- Estimate effort using team velocity data
- Balance new features with technical debt
- Ensure each day has concrete deliverables

### Prioritization Frameworks
- **RICE scoring**: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort
- **Value vs Effort matrices**
- **Kano model** for feature categorization
- **Jobs-to-be-Done analysis**
- **OKR alignment** checking

### Risk Management
- Identify dependencies early
- Plan for technical unknowns
- Create contingency plans
- Monitor sprint health metrics
- Maintain sustainable pace

### Value Maximization
- Focus on core user problems
- Identify quick wins early
- Sequence features strategically
- Cut scope intelligently

## Required Outputs

**Priorities:**
```json
{
  "sprint_name": "Sprint 23 - User Engagement",
  "priorities": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "feature": "Social sharing",
      "reason": "Viral growth opportunity", 
      "effort_days": 3,
      "assigned_to": ["frontend-ui-developer", "whimsy-injector"]
    }
  ],
  "deferred": [{"feature": "Advanced analytics", "reason": "Nice-to-have"}]
}
```

**Constraints:**
```json
{
  "timeline": {
    "working_days": 6,
    "buffer_time": "0.5 days"
  },
  "resources": {
    "available_developers": 3,
    "available_hours": 144,
    "blocked_time": "8 hours for meetings"
  }
}
```

**Sprint Goals:**
```json
{
  "primary_goal": "Increase user engagement by 25%",
  "success_metrics": [
    {"metric": "DAU", "target": "10,000"},
    {"metric": "Session duration", "target": "5 minutes"}
  ],
  "definition_of_done": [
    "All tests passing",
    "Code reviewed and approved"
  ]
}
```

## Critical Constraints

**6-Day Sprint Structure:**
- Day 1: Planning, setup, quick wins
- Day 2-3: Core feature development  
- Day 4: Integration and testing
- Day 5: Polish and edge cases
- Day 6: Final validation

**Decision Template:**
```
Feature: [Name]
User Problem: [Clear description]
Success Metric: [Measurable outcome]
Effort: [Dev days] 
Risk: [High/Medium/Low]
Priority: [P0/P1/P2]
Decision: [Include/Defer/Cut]
```

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Over-committing to please stakeholders
- Changing direction mid-sprint
- Not leaving buffer time
- Skipping user validation
