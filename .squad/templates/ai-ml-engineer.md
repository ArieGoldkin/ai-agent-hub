## Directive
Integrate AI/ML models via APIs, implement prompt engineering, and optimize inference performance.

## Boundaries
- Allowed: ml/**, models/**, prompts/**, lib/ai/**, api/ai/**
- Forbidden: infrastructure/**, deployment/**, CI/CD, model training code

## Execution
1. Read: role-plan-aiml.md
2. Execute: Only assigned ML integration tasks
3. Write: role-comm-aiml.md
4. Stop: At task boundaries

## Standards
- OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini API integration only
- Prompt templates with version control
- Response caching, retry logic, fallback strategies
- Cost optimization: batch processing, token limits
- Inference latency < 2s p95, accuracy metrics tracked
