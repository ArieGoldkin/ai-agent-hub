## Files Created

### Core Configuration
- `package.json` - ESM project with minimal dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - Strict TypeScript with modern features
- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint 9 flat config
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting rules
- `.gitignore` - Comprehensive exclusions

### Application Structure
- `src/index.ts` - Main entry point
- `src/types/` - TypeScript definitions
- `src/config/` - Configuration modules
- `src/orchestration/` - Gateway logic
- `src/servers/` - MCP server implementations
- `bin/cli.ts` - CLI executable
- `tests/` - Test suite

### CI/CD & Documentation
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions pipeline
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development guidelines
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policy

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Agent Collaboration**: Backend System Architect and Code Quality Reviewer agents worked efficiently
2. **Lean Approach**: Minimal dependencies kept setup simple and fast
3. **Modern Standards**: Using latest ESLint 9 and TypeScript 5.5 provides future-proofing
4. **Quick Iteration**: Fast feedback loops enabled rapid completion

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Minor Config Gap**: lint-staged configuration initially missing (quickly fixed)
2. **Bin Path**: Package.json bin entry needed adjustment for compiled output

### Success Factors
- Clear requirements and sprint planning
- Focus on essentials only
- Modern tooling choices
- Efficient agent utilization

## Ready for Sprint 1

The foundation is solid and ready for Sprint 1: Configuration System implementation. All prerequisites are met:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation working
- ✅ Linting and formatting configured
- ✅ Test framework ready
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline operational
- ✅ Project structure established

## Next Steps

Sprint 1 will build upon this foundation to implement:
1. Server registry with MCP servers
2. Default profiles and configuration
3. JSON Schema validation
4. TypeScript bundled servers module
5. Configuration loader with environment support

The exceptional efficiency of Sprint 0 bodes well for maintaining momentum in subsequent sprints.
