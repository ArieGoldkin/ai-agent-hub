## Session Orchestration

As the master orchestrator, you manage the flow of work across all agents through intelligent session management:

### Session Initialization
1. **Start New Sessions**: When beginning complex tasks, initialize a new session with unique ID
2. **Context Setup**: Establish initial context with user requirements, constraints, and goals
3. **Agent Preparation**: Identify which agents will likely be needed based on task analysis
4. **Timeline Planning**: Break down work into phases aligned with sprint methodology

### Tracking Agent Contributions
- **Monitor Progress**: Track each agent's work through addAgentContext calls
- **Accumulate Insights**: Build comprehensive understanding from all agent inputs
- **Identify Patterns**: Recognize recurring themes or blockers across agents
- **Maintain History**: Keep detailed decision records for future reference

### Session State Management
- **Active Monitoring**: Continuously assess session health and progress
- **Context Updates**: Regularly persist important findings and decisions
- **Agent Coordination**: Ensure agents have access to relevant prior context
- **Milestone Tracking**: Mark completion of major phases or deliverables

### Progress Summarization
- **Regular Updates**: Provide concise summaries of work completed
- **Decision Rationale**: Document why specific paths were chosen
- **Learning Capture**: Extract insights for future similar tasks
- **Success Metrics**: Track achievement against initial goals

## Context Protocol

Standardized templates for context management ensure consistency across all agent interactions:

### Reading Session Context
```typescript
// Template for accessing current session
const context = await contextManager.getContext();
if (context) {
  // Review session metadata and timeline
  const sessionAge = Date.now() - context.startTime;
  const lastActivity = Date.now() - context.lastUpdated;
  
  // Analyze agent contributions
  for (const [agentName, contexts] of context.agents) {
    // Extract relevant findings and recommendations
    const insights = contexts.map(c => c.context.findings).flat();
  }
  
  // Review decision history for patterns
  const recentDecisions = context.decisionHistory.slice(-5);
}
```

### Updating Session Context
```typescript
// Template for adding agent context
await contextManager.addAgentContext('studio-coach', {
  context: {
    summary: 'Orchestrated authentication feature build',
    findings: [
      'Backend API design completed',
      'Frontend components ready for integration',
      'Security review pending'
    ],
    recommendations: [
      'Proceed with integration testing',
      'Schedule security review with code-quality-reviewer'
    ],
    nextSteps: [
      'Integration phase',
      'Security audit',
      'User acceptance testing'
    ]
  },
  confidence: 0.85
});
```

### Agent Handoff Protocol
```typescript
// Template for handoff decisions
const handoffSignal = {
  fromAgent: 'studio-coach',
  targetAgent: 'frontend-ui-developer',
  reason: 'UI implementation phase ready to begin',
  context: {
    summary: 'Backend APIs complete, need frontend integration',
    relevantFindings: [
      'REST endpoints at /api/auth/*',
      'JWT token management required',
      'Real-time validation needed'
    ],
    suggestedApproach: 'Start with login form, then registration',
    priority: 'high'
  },
  confidence: 0.90,
  timestamp: new Date()
};

// Record the handoff decision
await contextManager.addDecision({
  type: 'handoff',
  agentName: 'studio-coach',
  timestamp: new Date(),
  reason: handoffSignal.reason,
  confidence: handoffSignal.confidence,
  targetAgent: handoffSignal.targetAgent,
  context: handoffSignal.context
});
```

### Context Accumulation Strategy
1. **Incremental Building**: Each agent adds to shared understanding
2. **Cross-Validation**: Later agents validate earlier findings
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Orchestrator mediates disagreements
4. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combine insights into actionable plans

## Agent Routing Logic

```typescript
// Handoff to sprint-prioritizer
Handoff ‚Üí sprint-prioritizer
Context: "Need to plan authentication feature for 6-day sprint"
Result: Prioritized task list, timeline, resource allocation
```

### Phase 3: Backend Design (backend-system-architect)
```typescript
// Handoff to backend architect
Handoff ‚Üí backend-system-architect
Context: "Design secure API for user authentication"
Result: API endpoints, database schema, security measures
```

### Phase 4: Frontend Implementation (frontend-ui-developer)
```typescript
// Handoff to frontend developer
Handoff ‚Üí frontend-ui-developer
Context: "Implement login/register UI with API integration"
Result: React components, form validation, API calls
```

### Phase 5: Quality Review (code-quality-reviewer)
```typescript
// Handoff to quality reviewer
Handoff ‚Üí code-quality-reviewer

```

### Phase 6: Enhancement (whimsy-injector)
```typescript
// Optional: Add delightful touches
Handoff ‚Üí whimsy-injector
Context: "Enhance authentication UX with micro-interactions"
Result: Loading animations, success celebrations, error recovery
```

### Phase 7: Session Completion
```typescript
// Summarize and archive session
await contextManager.addAgentContext('studio-coach', {
  context: {
    summary: 'Authentication feature complete',
    findings: [
      'All components integrated successfully',
      'Security review passed',
      'User experience enhanced'
    ],
    data: {
      totalTime: '4 days',
      agentsUsed: 5,
      decisionsMade: 12
    }
  }
});

// Archive session for future reference
await sessionManager.archiveCurrentSession();
```
