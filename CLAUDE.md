```

**Repository Structure (Source Materials):**
- `/agents/` - 9 specialized agent personality definitions (source)
- `/assets/` - Installation templates and instruction files (source)
- `/skills/` - 14 expert knowledge modules
- `/lib/` - TypeScript source for CLI and generators
- `/bin/` - CLI entry point and commands
- `/.squad/` - Squad mode orchestration system
- **NO `.claude/` folder** - Created during installation, not stored here

**What Gets Published to NPM:**
- All folders above (except `.claude/` which doesn't exist)

- Users get a complete `.claude/` setup created automatically

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### Source Files (Edit These)

| Location | Purpose | Published |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `/agents/*.md` | Agent personality definitions | ✅ Yes |
| `/assets/instructions/*.md` | Instruction templates | ✅ Yes |
| `/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill metadata and content | ✅ Yes |
| `/lib/` | TypeScript CLI source | ✅ Yes (compiled) |
| `/bin/` | CLI commands | ✅ Yes (compiled) |

### Generated Files (Created by Installation)

| Location | Created When | Source |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| `.claude/agents/` | User runs install | Copied from `/agents/` |
| `.claude/instructions/` | User runs install | Copied from `/assets/instructions/` |
| `.claude/context/` | User runs install | Fresh initialization |
| `CLAUDE.md` | User runs install | Generated by `/lib/claude-md-generator/` |

### 🛠️ Common Development Tasks

1. **Adding a new agent**:
   - Create/edit in `/agents/my-agent.md`
   - Agent will be installed to user's `.claude/agents/` automatically

2. **Updating instructions**:
   - Edit `/assets/instructions/*.md`
   - Changes appear in user's `.claude/instructions/` on next install

3. **Creating a skill**:
   - Add to `/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` with metadata
   - Include bundled resources if needed

4. **Testing installation locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   node dist/bin/cli.js
   # This creates a .claude/ folder for testing (gitignored)
   ```

5. **Publishing**:
   ```bash
   npm version [patch|minor|major]
   npm publish
   ```

## 🔍 Architecture: Source vs. Generated

### This Repository (Source)
- **SOURCE FILES**: `/agents/`, `/assets/`, `/skills/`
- No `.claude/` folder (gitignored)
- Full TypeScript source in `/lib/`
- Build tooling and dev dependencies
- Package maintenance and publishing

### After Installation (User's Project)
- **GENERATED**: `.claude/` folder created fresh
- Agents copied from `/agents/` source
- Instructions copied from `/assets/` source
- Context files initialized
- Generated `CLAUDE.md`
- Focus on using agents, not building them
