What are Sessions?
  Sessions track agent collaboration and decision-making across your
  work. They enable agents to share context and make informed handoffs,
  creating a more intelligent and coordinated AI assistant experience.

Session Storage:
  Current: .claude/session-context.json
  Archive: .claude/session-archive.json (last 10 sessions)

Note:
  Sessions are automatically created when agents interact. Use these
  commands to manage sessions manually when needed.
